picking stuff up after it moves away gives error

need to disable wall jumps

Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

can attack AI after being smushed and revive him, same with any of his states, the take damage state shoulc be ignored if he is stuck, smashed, slipping, falling in a pit, etc

hole trap still doesnt work 

ai notices you just barely moving while completely behind him and crouching, maybe needs tweaking
