HIGHER PRIORITY:

AI detects all objects, ie trucks, cubes, barricades, as dark by default. You cant blend in with a white truck while white, but you can while black?

guards all stop navigating through their paths and walk in palce when you hit something with a slingshot?

hole trap still doesnt work  

AI doesnt do anything if he has no path points, he should just post up there and chase if he sees someone

if the enemy misses the player the enemy will just get stuck in this running in place state right next to the player

Lower Priority:

Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

ai also sometimes slides in idle pose while patrolling with no player visible

Ai also seem to stand up out of ragdoll all in sync

 AI cant go straight into ragdolled state whe he spawns, traps dont effect him for the first like 2 seconds he spawns

AI doesnt seem to ever give up if he is chasing something he doesnt see or ever reach

it seems like grabbing the player is not working well rn, the enemy seems to miss a lot
