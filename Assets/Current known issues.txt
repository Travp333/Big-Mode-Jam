need to disable wall jumps

Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

can attack AI after being smushed and revive him, same with any of his states, the take damage state shoulc be ignored if he is stuck, smashed, slipping, falling in a pit, etc

hole trap still doesnt work 

ai notices you just barely moving while completely behind him and crouching, maybe needs tweaking

need to sync up enemy holding player states 

choked player does not sync materials with actual player

colorswapping loses expressions
