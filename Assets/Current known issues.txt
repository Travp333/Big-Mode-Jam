HIGHER PRIORITY:

when leaving grabbed state your first person model appears


guards all stop navigating through their paths and walk in palce when you hit something with a slingshot?

hole trap still doesnt work  

if the enemy misses the player the enemy will just get stuck in this running in place state right next to the player

Lower Priority:

AI when stuck in glue trap can still be pushed around

Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

ai also sometimes slides in idle pose while patrolling 

Ai also seem to stand up out of ragdoll all in sync

 AI cant go straight into ragdolled state whe he spawns, traps dont effect him for the first like 2 seconds he spawns

AI doesnt seem to ever give up if he is chasing something on an inacessible part of the navmesh

it seems like grabbing the player is not working well rn, the enemy seems to miss a lot
