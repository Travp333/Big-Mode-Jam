Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

ai also sometimes slides in idle pose while patrolling with no player visible

Ai also seem to stand up out of ragdoll all in sync

can attack AI after being smushed and revive him, same with any of his states, the take damage state shoulc be ignored if he is stuck, smashed, slipping, falling in a pit, etc

hole trap still doesnt work 

ai notices you just barely moving while completely behind him and crouching, maybe needs tweaking

need to sync up enemy holding player states 

 AI cant go straight into ragdolled state whe he spawns, traps dont effect him for the first like 2 seconds he spawns

AI doesnt do anything if he has no path points, he should jsut post up there and chase if he sees someone 

ai footstep detection doesnt seem to work in new scene

AI mesh renderer isnt dynamic on choked dummy

AI doesnt seem to ever give up if he is chasing something he doesnt see or ever reach
