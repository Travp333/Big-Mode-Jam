Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

can attack AI after being smushed and revive him, same with any of his states, the take damage state shoulc be ignored if he is stuck, smashed, slipping, falling in a pit, etc

hole trap still doesnt work 

ai notices you just barely moving while completely behind him and crouching, maybe needs tweaking

need to sync up enemy holding player states 

 AI cant go straight into ragdolled state whe he spawns, traps dont effect him for the first like 2 seconds he spawns

AI cant detect color on moving truck

thrown objects stay in the pickupable iteams list so you can just call it right back
