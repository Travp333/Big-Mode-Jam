should not be able to aim and pick stuff up, aiming / armed / holding in general dont play well together 

picking stuff up after it moves away gives error

need to disable wall jumps

Ai sometimes walks in place while patrolling

can attack AI after being smushed and revive him

hole trap still doesnt work 

ai notices you just barely moving while completely behind him and crouching, maybe needs tweaking
